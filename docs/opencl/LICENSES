OR RELATED DOCUMENTATION IN TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY,

ADVICE GIVEN BY AMD OR AMD'S AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A 
WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY.  SHOULD THE

REPRESENTATIVE) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR 
OR CORRECTION.  THE SOFTWARE IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN MEDICAL, LIFE SAVING

construed under the laws of the state of California without reference to its 
conflict of law principles.  In the event of any conflicts between foreign 
law, rules, and regulations, and United States law, rules, and regulations, 
United States rules and regulations shall prevail and govern.  The United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not 
apply to this License.  If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction 
finds any provision of this License or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, 
that provision of the License shall be enforced to the maximum extent 
permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of 
this License shall continue in full force and effect.

13.  Complete Agreement.  This License constitutes the entire agreement 
between the parties with respect to the use of the Software and the related
